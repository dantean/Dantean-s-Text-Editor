# J.A.T.E. - Just Another Text Editor

## Description

A progressive web application that runs a simple text editor in the browser, and gives an option to install locally. 

## How To Use

To run locally, first clone the repo and then type `npm start` in the terminal. After that, open your browser and navigate to `localhost:3000`. You can use the application directly from the browser, or click the `Install` button to install a local copy on your machine. 

When running the application through the live link, you can simply use it or click `install` :)
